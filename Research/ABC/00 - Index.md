# ABC

## Definition

- [[01 - Experiment Definition|01 — Experiment Definition]] — problem statement, proposed end-state framework, and the four-phase path from reactive fetching to speculative prefetching.
- [[02 - Phase 1 Naive Prefetch Implementation Guide|02 — Phase 1 Naive Prefetch Implementation Guide (historical)]] — original post-miss N-chunk read-ahead design; its Phase 1 policy was rejected by the NVMe validation and is superseded by guide 04.
- [[03 - Phase 2 Heuristic Prefetch Implementation Guide|03 — Phase 2 Heuristic Prefetch Implementation Guide (tentative)]] — adaptive N controller, feature-based block selection, and sliding-window group support; tentative pending Phase 1 proof.
- [[04 - Phase 1 Queued-Request Oracle Prefetch Implementation Guide|04 — Phase 1 Queued-Request Oracle Prefetch Implementation Guide]] — implementation design for blind first-N promotion at request admission, with request-level warm-up gating, direct NVMe→CPU loads, failure attribution, and tests.

## Reports

- [[2026-08-10 - ABC Nemotron no-offload versus CPU-offload KV lookup report|2026-08-10 — Nemotron no-offload versus CPU-offload KV lookup report]]
- [[2026-08-14 - Phase 1 CPU prefetch validation|2026-08-14 — Phase 1 CPU prefetch validation]] — rejected Phase 1 batch: `prefetch_chunks=100` was enabled but every attempted chunk was skipped because no secondary tier was configured.
- [[2026-08-14 - Phase 1 NVMe prefetch validation|2026-08-14 — Phase 1 NVMe prefetch validation]] — mechanism diagnosis with an active NVMe tier: demand lookup worked, but every post-miss prefetch candidate was skipped.
- [[2026-08-14 - Phase 1 queued-request oracle prefetch plan|2026-08-14 — Phase 1 queued-request oracle prefetch plan]] — blind first-N queued-request experiment to isolate the performance value of correctly timed NVMe→CPU promotion.
- [[2026-08-17 - Phase 1 admission prefetch first execution report|2026-08-17 — Phase 1 admission prefetch first execution report]] — invalid/inconclusive first execution: N=100 was rendered, but a manager/scheduler attribute mismatch reduced the scheduler-visible limit to zero, so no proactive work ran. Includes native request, offload, queue, transfer, and NVMe evidence.
- [[2026-08-18 - Phase 1 admission prefetch repaired-image validation|2026-08-18 — Phase 1 admission prefetch repaired-image validation]] — first successful mechanism execution: 25,344 NVMe→CPU promotions, 100% eventually useful, 92.97% ready at first demand, and no failures. Performance remains inconclusive because the control completed only 255/256 requests.

## Current conclusion

The original Phase 1 post-miss read-ahead policy remains closed as rejected. vLLM hashes are prefix-chained and the filesystem tier is append-like, so a stored later chunk normally implies its predecessor was also stored. Selecting later keys after a resolved terminal miss therefore produces candidates that are normally absent.

Phase 1 now means the queued-request oracle proof of concept in guide 04: build the first `N` keys at request admission, bypass secondary membership lookup, and directly submit assumed-resident NVMe→CPU promotions while the request waits. The benchmark controls residency by construction and uses `kv_transfer_params.abc_admission_prefetch` to disable prefetch during NVMe population and enable it only for measured requests.

The first live execution on 2026-08-17 did **not** exercise that mechanism. The manager stored the parsed value as `_admission_prefetch_chunks`, while the scheduler read `manager.admission_prefetch_chunks` with a zero fallback. All nine prefetch metric queries were empty in the N=100 cell. The performance result is therefore invalid/inconclusive for proactive prefetch; the slower treatment aggregate is run variability between effectively non-prefetching cells. The local vLLM working tree now exposes a read-only manager property matching the scheduler contract, has a real-manager scheduler regression test, and passes the focused tiering and admission/lookup suites. No corrected image or live mechanism result exists yet.

A repeat on 2026-08-18 also did **not** contain the repair: both nominal N=0 and N=100 pods resolved the old `v0.27.0-prefetch-p1` digest `32a580...`. The N=100 cell again had no prefetch series. Its apparent p95 TTFT improvement is non-evidence because no proactive work ran, only one repetition exists, the cells used different nodes, and the nominal control completed only 255/256 requests. No corrected image or live mechanism result exists yet.

The repaired-image execution later on 2026-08-18 **passed the Phase 1 mechanism proof**. Both cells used digest `097cffbd...`; N=100 attempted 25,600 blocks, promoted 25,344, classified 256 redundant, and eventually used all 25,344 promotions. Exactly 1,782 promotions (7.03%) were late at first demand, so 92.97% were ready in time. There were no skips, waste, tracking overflow, or load failures. The observed TTFT tail was better, but performance remains inconclusive because the N=0 control again completed only 255/256 requests, nodes differed, JIT occurred during measurement, and only one pair exists.

The deployment and workload scaffolding otherwise worked: all three cells completed 256/256 requests without errors, both custom cells used the same immutable image digest, warm-up sent the request gate as false and measurement as true, the server rendered N=0 versus N=100 correctly, one sequence ran with roughly 6–7 waiting, and normal reactive NVMe offload remained active.

## Next experiment

The mechanism gate is now accepted on repaired digest `097cffbd...`. The next experiment is the performance proof:

1. fix or work around the GuideLLM final-request race and require exactly 256/256 processed requests in every cell;
2. move `_swap_blocks_kernel` JIT before the measured phase;
3. run at least five paired N=0/N=100 repetitions on the same node, or balance and interleave node placement;
4. retain the same repaired digest, request gates, workload, and cache-population procedure;
5. use late/promoted as the timing diagnostic and evaluate paired TTFT/throughput only after every validity gate passes.

After a repeatable performance result, sweep `N ∈ {25, 50, 100, 200}`.
